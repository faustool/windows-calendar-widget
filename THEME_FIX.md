# Theme Toggle Fix

## Problem
The theme toggle button (üåô/‚òÄÔ∏è) was not visually changing the application colors when clicked, even though the button icon was changing.

## Root Cause
The theme switching mechanism had several issues:

1. **Resource Dictionary Access**: The `ApplyTheme` method was trying to access theme ResourceDictionaries incorrectly
2. **Static Resource Lookup**: Code-generated UI elements were using `FindResource` which looks up resources at compile time, not runtime
3. **Missing Refresh**: After changing theme resources, the existing UI elements weren't being refreshed with new colors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Resource Dictionary Access
**Before:**
```csharp
var theme = (ResourceDictionary)Application.Current.Resources[themeKey];
Application.Current.Resources.MergedDictionaries.Clear();
Application.Current.Resources.MergedDictionaries.Add(theme);
```

**After:**
```csharp
var theme = (ResourceDictionary)Application.Current.Resources[themeKey];
if (theme != null)
{
    // Update the main resource dictionary with theme colors
    foreach (var key in theme.Keys)
    {
        Application.Current.Resources[key] = theme[key];
    }
}
```

### 2. Added UI Refresh After Theme Change
- Added `RefreshEventDisplay()` call after theme application
- Enhanced `RefreshElementZoom()` to also update theme colors
- Recursively updates all UI elements with new theme brushes

### 3. Enhanced Theme Color Updates
The refresh method now updates:
- **TextBlock Foreground**: Uses `ForegroundBrush` resource
- **Button Foreground**: Uses `ForegroundBrush` resource  
- **Border Background**: Uses `SecondaryBrush` resource
- **Border BorderBrush**: Uses `BorderBrush` resource

### 4. Added Theme Persistence
- Theme preference is now saved to `appsettings.json`
- Theme setting is restored on application startup
- Changes are persisted automatically when toggling

## Theme Colors

### Light Theme
- **Background**: `#FFFFFF` (White)
- **Foreground**: `#000000` (Black)
- **Accent**: `#0078D4` (Microsoft Blue)
- **Secondary**: `#F3F2F1` (Light Gray)
- **Border**: `#E1DFDD` (Light Border)

### Dark Theme
- **Background**: `#1E1E1E` (Dark Gray)
- **Foreground**: `#FFFFFF` (White)
- **Accent**: `#0078D4` (Microsoft Blue)
- **Secondary**: `#2D2D30` (Dark Secondary)
- **Border**: `#3F3F46` (Dark Border)

## Testing the Fix

### Visual Verification
1. **Start the application** - should load with saved theme preference
2. **Click the theme toggle** (üåô for dark, ‚òÄÔ∏è for light)
3. **Observe changes**:
   - Window background color changes
   - Text color changes (black ‚Üî white)
   - Event box colors change
   - Button colors change
   - Border colors change

### Expected Behavior
- **Light Theme**: White background, black text, light gray event boxes
- **Dark Theme**: Dark gray background, white text, darker event boxes
- **Smooth Transition**: All elements update immediately when toggled
- **Persistence**: Theme choice is remembered between app sessions

## Debug Output
Added comprehensive debug logging to track theme switching:
```
Applying theme: DarkTheme
Found theme dictionary with 7 keys
Updated BackgroundBrush: #FFFFFF -> #1E1E1E
Updated ForegroundBrush: #000000 -> #FFFFFF
...
Theme applied successfully. Button content: ‚òÄÔ∏è
```

## Configuration
Theme preference is stored in `%APPDATA%\M365CalendarApp\appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "Application": {
    "DefaultTheme": "Dark"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Theme Not Changing
1. **Check Debug Output**: Look for theme application messages in debug console
2. **Verify Resources**: Ensure `LightTheme` and `DarkTheme` ResourceDictionaries exist in App.xaml
3. **Clear Cache**: Delete `appsettings.json` to reset to default light theme

### Partial Theme Changes
- Some elements may not update if they're not included in the refresh logic
- Check that all UI elements use the correct resource keys
- Verify that `RefreshElementZoom` is being called after theme changes

### Performance
- Theme switching is now immediate with no noticeable delay
- All UI elements are updated in a single pass
- Resource updates are efficient and don't cause memory leaks

The theme toggle now provides a smooth, immediate visual transition between light and dark modes, with proper persistence of user preferences.
